# Viola_FaceDetection

I use python as my programming language in this project and I use Visual Studio 2019 under windows10 system as my programming environment.

I used glob,which is embedded in python to find paths of the document which I want to load, for example,paths of all images in the testset and the  trainset. And I used the opencv3 to read a pixel value in an image.  And I  used matplotlib to show all features in each round during the process of adaboost and Trend graphs of Adaboost. Before Adaboost running, I use feature selection section in scikit-learn to filter top 10% best features to run make my code run faster.
